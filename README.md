For Cobblemon 1.4, Fabric Version

Adds the ability to cook the berries from Cobblemon in the furnace, smoker, and fire to produce an edible variant. 

Currently only the oran berry has been added. 

There is a commented out test raw_oran_berry that purely serves as practice and an example on how to create multiple items.
